# OverflowDetection
Code and example dataset for detecting overflow using Sentinel 1 SAR imagery. 

Note that this set of code uses material from HydroSAR (https://github.com/HydroSAR/HydroSAR?tab=readme-ov-file)

Instructions:
  - First, go to ASF's VERTEX page to start a project.
    - Select decibels. 
  - Second, use a GIS software to create a shapefile to subset your SAR imagery. 
  - Use c1 to download the project from VERTEX.
  - Use c2 to subset your SAR imagery to a reasonable size.
     - This step is optional, but HIGHLY recommended. Without it, the region to search is insanely huge and will take a very long time to process. 
  - Use c3 to locate possible overflow locations.
